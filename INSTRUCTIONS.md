# PWA Icons Instructions

To complete the PWA setup, you need to create two icon files in the public directory:

1. `public/pwa-192x192.png` - A 192x192 pixel PNG icon
2. `public/pwa-512x512.png` - A 512x512 pixel PNG icon

These icons should be consistent with your application branding and use the same design as the favicon.svg file. The icons are required for PWA installation on various devices.

You can create these icons using any image editing software such as:
- Adobe Photoshop
- GIMP (free)
- Figma
- Sketch
- Or an online tool like https://realfavicongenerator.net/

The recommended icon design should:
- Use the primary color (#4a6fb5) as the background
- Include a simple, recognizable symbol (like the pencil in the favicon.svg)
- Have transparent margins around the main content
- Be readable at small sizes

After creating these icons, place them in the public directory, and they will be automatically included in the PWA manifest when you build the project.
